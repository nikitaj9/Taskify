TS Terminologies

1. Strongly typed languages demand the specifications of data types
    This is what we do in TypeScript. TS is a strongly typed language where we speify the types of the data we are using and that helps to self-document and enforce our code. 

2. Loosely Typed languages - do not require type specifications
    JavaScript is a loosely typed language which is also referred to a weekly typed language

Relates to: 
    - Static Typing
    - Dynamic Typing
    - Static and Dynamic typing are not same as Strongly typed  and Loosely typed. 

A language that is strongly typed can either be statically OR dynamically typed!

##TypeScript is a Statically typed language. 
    - This means types are checked at compile time.
##JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
    - This means types are checked at the run time.


TypeScript Benefits: 
    - Self-documenting
    - Catch errors in dev
    - Great for teams
